Riak Dev Cluster for OS X
=========================

*NOTE: This project currently installs Riak 2.0.5*

Easily run a 5-node [Riak](http://www.basho.com/riak) cluster on OS X.

The Basho documentation enumerates the [Five Minute Install](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/quickstart/). While a straightforward, and useful, exercise to undergo the tutorial is based upon a source build. As a result, in some environments, it can be a time-intensive process.

This repository uses the pre-packaged binaries for OS X (found in the [Downloads](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/) section of the documentation) embed the Erlang runtime. This eliminates the need to build Riak from source and install Erlang.

By default, the rake task installs 5 nodes of Riak running on a local machine in a fashion similar to the `devrel` build target. In essence, it creates five full Riak stacks (including Erlang virtual machines) to run on one server to simulate a cluster. This is useful in a development environment, but running Riak on a single server for benchmarking or production use is counterproductive. This is discussed in greater detail in a blog post entitled [*Riak Development Anti-Patterns*](http://basho.com/riak-development-anti-patterns/)

## Important Considerations
* The names of the nodes are riak[1-5]@127.0.0.1
* The HTTP port of riak1 is 11098: <http://127.0.0.1:11098>
* Riak Control (Admin UI) is available [here](http://127.0.0.1:11098/admin)
* All nodes use the [LevelDB](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/) storage backend 
* [Riak Search](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/search/) is disabled 
* The `/etc/riak.conf` in each node's directory enumerates all other ports and settings

## Getting started

1) Ensure that [Open File Limits](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/tuning/open-files-limit/#Mac-OS-X) are set per most recent Basho recommendations. This step, which is manual, is important to ensure that Riak behaves properly.

2) Clone the repository and navigate to the folder:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/basho/riak-dev-cluster.git
$ cd riak-dev-cluster
```

3) There is a `bootstrap` command available that downloads the pre-packaged OS X binary, installs, starts, and joins the Riak cluster in one go:

```
rake bootstrap
```

4) Verify that all nodes have started, and joined the cluster:

````
rake member_status
````

5) Riak is up and running! You can [Test the Cluster](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/quickstart/#Test-the-Cluster) or progress directly to [A Taste of Riak](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/taste-of-riak/)

## Control commands
This project includes multiple rake tasks that make interacting with your Riak cluster nearly as simple as operating a cluster in production. Several of the common tasks are enumerated in greater detail below.

```
rake start
```

Start all nodes in the cluster using the Riak command line option [start](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/tools/riak/#start):  `./riak[1-5]/bin/riak start`. 

```
rake stop
```

Stop all nodes in the cluster using the Riak command line option [stop](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/tools/riak/#stop):  `./riak[1-5]/bin/riak stop`. 

```
rake clear
```

Clear all data by first completing the `rake stop` task and then deleting directories (via rm -rf).

```
rake restart
```

Restart all nodes in the cluster without clearing all data by running the `rake stop` task followed by the `rake start` task.

```
rake join
```

Join all nodes as a cluster using the Riak command line option [join](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/tools/riak-admin/#join) with the force option. If the cluster is stopped or restarted, this command only needs issued once. If the cluster is cleared, it must be reissued:  `./riak[2-5]/bin/riak-admin join -f riak1@127.0.0.1`. 

## Riak Data Types

There are a few `rake` commands that will set up your cluster to use [Riak Data Types](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.0/dev/using/data-types/). You can create a [bucket type](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.2/dev/advanced/bucket-types/) for using [Riak counters](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.0.2/dev/using/data-types/#Counters) called `counters`:

```
rake counter_bucket
```

You can do the same for sets:

```
rake set_bucket
```

And for maps:

```
rake map_bucket
```

## Other commands

See all available commands by running `rake -T` or just `rake` by itself.

### Note

Depending on your Erlang cookie, you may have to use the commands with `sudo`.
